The operation could not be completed. The parameter is incorrect. 

Use:
devenv  [solutionfile | projectfile | folder | anyfile.ext]  [switches]

The first argument for devenv is usually a solution file, project file or a folder.
You can also use any other file as the first argument if you want to have the
file open automatically in an editor. When you enter a project file, the IDE
looks for an .sln file with the same base name as the project file in the
parent directory for the project file. If no such .sln file exists, then the
IDE looks for a single .sln file that references the project. If no such single
.sln file exists, then the IDE creates an unsaved solution with a default .sln
file name that has the same base name as the project file.

Command line builds:
devenv solutionfile.sln /build [ solutionconfig ] [ /project projectnameorfile [ /projectconfig name ] ]
Available command line switches:

/Build			Builds the solution or project with the specified solution
			configuration. For example "Debug". If multiple platforms
			are possible, the configuration name must be enclosed in quotes
			and contain platform name. For example: "Debug|Win32".
/Clean			Deletes build outputs.
/Command		Starts the IDE and executes the command.
/Deploy			Builds and then deploys the specified build configuration.
/DoNotLoadProjects	Opens the specified solution without loading any projects.
/Edit			Opens the specified files in a running instance of this
			application. If there are no running instances, it will
			start a new instance with a simplified window layout.
/LCID			Sets the default language in the IDE for the UI.
/Log			Logs IDE activity to the specified file for troubleshooting.
/NoVSIP			Disables the VSIP developer's license key for VSIP testing.
/Out			Appends the build log to a specified file.
/Project		Specifies the project to build, clean, or deploy.
			Must be used with /Build, /Rebuild, /Clean, or /Deploy.
/ProjectConfig		Overrides the project configuration specified in the solution
			configuration. For example "Debug". If multiple platforms are
			possible, the configuration name must be enclosed in quotes
			and contain platform name. For example: "Debug|Win32".
			Must be used with /Project.
/Rebuild		Cleans and then builds the solution or project with the
			specified configuration.
/ResetSettings		Restores the IDE's default settings, optionally resets to
			the specified VSSettings file.
/ResetSkipPkgs		Clears all SkipLoading tags added to VSPackages.
/Run			Compiles and runs the specified solution.
/RunExit		Compiles and runs the specified solution then closes the IDE.
/SafeMode		Launches the IDE in safe mode loading minimal windows.
/Upgrade		Upgrades the project or the solution and all projects in it.
			A backup of these files will be created as appropriate. Please
			see Help on 'Visual Studio Conversion Wizard' for more
			information on the backup process.

Product-specific switches:

/debugexe	Open the specified executable to be debugged. The remainder of 
		the command line is passed to this executable as its arguments.
/diff		Compares two files.  Takes four parameters:
		SourceFile, TargetFile, SourceDisplayName(optional),
		TargetDisplayName(optional)
/TfsLink	Opens Team Explorer and launches a viewer for the 
		provided artifact URI if one is registered.
