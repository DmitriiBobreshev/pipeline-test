# This step needs to download the right version (v0.8.24), and no other step should download any 0.8.x version

# For this step to work the 'Install older Node version' step needs to download the right version (v0.8.24), and no other step should download any 0.8.x version:
# if we pass '0.8.x' as pattern and set checkLatest to false the task should try to install the version that's already been cached
# since by default agent doesn't have any 0.8.x versions cached it's going to use the only 0.8.x version that's been downloaded previously: v0.8.24
