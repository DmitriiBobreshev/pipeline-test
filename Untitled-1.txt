Hello @adurangalvis and thank you for the detailed answer.
As I can see, you have all permissions to _tml folder and probably not with that.
To be sure that isn't a problem with the file system, could you please check is enough disk space for the agent.
Also the other side, it might be a RAM problem, so could you please make sure that you don't have any NODE_OPTIONS variable such as --max_old_space_size 
which possibly can affect on nodejs process, you can check it, for example by this task:
- task: CmdLine@2
  displayName: 'Check NodeJs HeapSize(MB)'
  inputs:
    script: |
      node -v
      node -e "console.log(require('v8').getHeapStatistics().total_available_size / 1024 / 1024)"
and, to be sure, that is a problem with node, could you please other Task which using node10, such as NodeTool, for example, like this:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: 'v14.17.1'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js v14.17.1'
