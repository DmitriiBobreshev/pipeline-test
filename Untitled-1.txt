Hi team, yesterday i mostly was working on "Exit code" issue, 
installed the same version of the agent, created a test pipeline 
and googled a lot about this error code and what is it mean,
as a result, it was possible to put forward two versions, first one 
that the customer doesn't have enough disk space, which is probably wrong
And the second one that the customer doesn't have enough RAM memory for process, that seems more perspective,
so now i wanna ask customer check do they have NODE_OPTIONS variable such as --max_old_space_size
and provide him some script to check how large his
nodejs memory heap, also i want to ask him to check is other nodejs tasks running correctly. 
Also today's morning Denis found that we have similar PR about MSBuild task so we decided to call after sync to discuss it.
So today i'm going to write some questions to customer about "Exit code" issue and get approve of it from Alexander
,call to denis 
and after that i'll take another task
